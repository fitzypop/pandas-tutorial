Following Corey Schafer's [Pandas Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTsWmV9i9c58mdDCSskIFdDS)

We'll be using csv data from Stackoverflow Developer Survey.

[Download the zip file](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) and unzip contents into the data folder. All Notebooks will look in the `data/` directory for csv files.

CSV and ZIP files have already been added to the .gitignore file.
